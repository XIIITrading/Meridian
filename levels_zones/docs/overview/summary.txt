Meridian Trading System: Levels & Zones Tool - Comprehensive Summary
Executive Overview
The Meridian Trading System's Levels & Zones tool is a sophisticated pre-market trading analysis platform designed to solve one of the most challenging problems in technical trading: identifying which price levels actually matter. At its core, the system operates on a fundamental principle - that M15 (15-minute) zones with the highest confluence of technical indicators represent the highest probability supply and demand zones that will hold during trading. By analyzing multiple timeframes, volume profiles, pivot calculations, and structural levels, then scoring their confluence with specific M15 zones, the tool transforms overwhelming market noise into clear, actionable trading opportunities.
Core Philosophy and Trading Edge
The tool's revolutionary approach centers on M15 Zone Prioritization through Confluence Scoring. Rather than presenting traders with dozens of potential support and resistance levels across multiple timeframes - a common problem that leads to analysis paralysis - the system identifies specific 15-minute zones where multiple technical factors align. This confluence-based approach operates on the proven market principle that zones where multiple timeframes and technical indicators converge have significantly higher probability of holding as supply or demand zones.
The system assigns each M15 zone a confluence score and level (L1 through L5), with L5 zones representing exceptional confluence where 12+ weighted technical factors align. This scoring system allows traders to focus exclusively on the highest-probability setups, effectively filtering out 80-90% of market noise while retaining the most significant trading opportunities.
System Architecture and Data Flow
Three-Tier Architecture
The Meridian system employs a robust three-tier architecture that ensures reliable data processing and user interaction:
Data Layer: At the foundation, the system integrates with two primary data sources:

Polygon REST API (via local server on port 8200) provides real-time and historical market data including OHLCV bars across multiple timeframes, from 1-minute to monthly aggregations
Supabase Database serves as the persistence layer, storing trading sessions, analysis results, and historical data for pattern recognition and backtesting

Calculation Engine: The heart of the system, containing specialized modules for:

Volume Profile Analysis (HVN identification across 7, 14, 30, 60, and 120-day periods)
Pivot Calculations (Camarilla pivots for daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes)
Zone Creation (transforming price levels into actionable zones using ATR-based bands)
Confluence Analysis (the crown jewel that scores M15 zones based on all inputs)

User Interface: A PyQt6-based GUI with dark theme optimization for extended trading sessions, featuring:

Real-time data input and validation
Visual confluence scoring displays
Comprehensive analysis result presentation
Database session management

Data Processing Pipeline
The system follows a sophisticated data processing pipeline that transforms raw market data into actionable trading zones:

Data Acquisition: User inputs ticker symbol and analysis datetime → System fetches comprehensive market data
Multi-Timeframe Analysis: Parallel processing of volume profiles, pivot calculations, and structural analysis
Zone Generation: Creation of zones from price levels using timeframe-appropriate ATR bands
M15 Zone Identification: Collection of specific 15-minute candlestick data for 6 key zones
Confluence Calculation: Scoring each M15 zone against all technical indicators
Prioritization and Output: Ranking zones by confluence score and presenting results

Technical Analysis Components
High Volume Node (HVN) Analysis
The HVN engine represents one of the most sophisticated components, analyzing volume distribution across price levels to identify where significant trading activity has occurred. The system processes volume profiles across five distinct timeframes:

7-day HVN: Captures immediate market structure and recent accumulation/distribution
14-day HVN: Identifies short-term volume peaks that often act as magnets
30-day HVN: Reveals intermediate-term market acceptance zones
60-day HVN: Shows quarterly volume concentrations
120-day HVN: Identifies major long-term support/resistance zones

Each timeframe analysis divides the price range into 100 levels, uses an 80th percentile threshold for significance, and employs scipy signal processing to identify genuine peaks versus noise. The system specifically prioritizes 15-day peaks for trending markets, recognizing that recent volume activity often carries more weight in dynamic market conditions.
Camarilla Pivot System
The Camarilla calculation engine provides precise support and resistance levels based on mathematical relationships proven effective in institutional trading:
Monthly Camarilla (Weight: 3.0): Major structural pivots that define long-term market boundaries

Calculates R1-R6 resistance and S1-S6 support levels
Uses 6-month aggregated data for stability
Provides the strongest confluence signals

Weekly Camarilla (Weight: 2.0): Swing trading pivots that capture intermediate momentum

Processes 8 weeks of data for calculation
Critical for multi-day position planning
R3/S3 levels often mark reversal zones

Daily Camarilla (Weight: 1.0): Intraday precision levels for day trading

Uses 5-day aggregated bars
Provides tight stop-loss and target levels
Central pivot acts as intraday bias indicator

Zone Creation Methodology
The system transforms static price levels into dynamic zones using ATR (Average True Range) based calculations, recognizing that markets require breathing room around key levels:
Weekly Zones (WL1-WL4):

Created using 1-hour ATR measurements
Zones extend 30 minutes above and below each level
Total zone width approximately 1 hour of price movement
Designed to capture swing trading opportunities

Daily Zones (DL1-DL6):

Constructed with 5-minute ATR bands
Zones span 10 minutes total (5 above, 5 below)
Optimized for intraday precision trading
Six levels provide granular support/resistance mapping

ATR Dynamic Zones:

Calculated as Current Price ± Daily ATR
Zone width determined by 5-minute ATR
Adapts to current market volatility
Provides context-sensitive trading boundaries

M15 Zone Data Collection
The system's unique focus on M15 zones involves precise candlestick data collection for six critical zones identified through preliminary analysis. For each zone, the system:

Fetches exact 15-minute candle data at specified datetime coordinates
Records high, low, open, close, and volume for each zone
Calculates zone boundaries and midpoints
Stores data for confluence analysis

These M15 zones represent potential turning points where institutional activity is most likely to occur, based on the convergence of multiple timeframe analyses.
Confluence Scoring Engine
Weight Distribution System
The confluence engine employs a sophisticated weight distribution system that reflects the relative importance of different technical factors:
Major Structural Levels (2.5-3.0 weight):

Monthly Camarilla pivots (3.0)
30-day HVN peaks (2.5)
Weekly structural zones (2.0)

Important Swing Levels (1.5-2.0 weight):

Weekly Camarilla pivots (2.0)
14-day HVN peaks (1.8)
Weekly zones from database (1.5)

Intraday Context (0.5-1.0 weight):

Daily zones (1.0)
ATR-based zones (0.8)
7-day HVN peaks (0.7)

Minor Levels (0.1-0.3 weight):

Daily Camarilla pivots (0.3)
Individual daily levels (0.2)
Reference prices (0.1)

Conclusion
The Meridian Trading System's Levels & Zones tool represents a paradigm shift in technical analysis, moving from information overload to focused, probability-based trading. By identifying and prioritizing M15 zones through sophisticated confluence analysis, the system provides traders with a clear edge: the ability to trade only the highest-probability supply and demand zones while ignoring market noise.
The fundamental innovation lies in recognizing that not all technical levels are created equal. When multiple timeframes, volume profiles, pivot calculations, and structural levels all point to the same M15 zone, the probability of that zone holding as support or resistance increases exponentially. This confluence-based approach, combined with sophisticated scoring algorithms and intuitive presentation, transforms complex market data into simple, actionable trading decisions.
The tool's comprehensive architecture - from data acquisition through calculation engines to visual presentation - ensures reliable, real-time analysis that can adapt to any market condition. Whether used for pre-market preparation, intraday execution, or swing trading planning, the system consistently identifies the zones where institutional activity is most likely to occur, providing traders with the edge needed for consistent profitability.
Ultimately, the Levels & Zones tool embodies the principle that successful trading isn't about predicting the future - it's about identifying where the highest probabilities lie and executing with discipline when those opportunities arise. By focusing exclusively on high-confluence M15 zones, traders can eliminate the paralysis of choice, reduce emotional decision-making, and trade with the confidence that comes from mathematical probability rather than hope or fear.
