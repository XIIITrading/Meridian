The supabase_client.py file serves as the data access layer between your application and the Supabase database. It:

Abstracts database operations - Other parts of your app don't need to know SQL or Supabase specifics
Handles data transformation - Converts between Python objects (dataclasses) and database records
Provides error handling - Centralizes database error management
Ensures data consistency - Manages transactions and relationships
Implements business logic - Like generating IDs, managing analysis runs, etc.

Line-by-Line Explanation
Imports Section (Lines 1-17)

Standard library imports: Handle types, dates, logging
Supabase imports: The client and exception handling
Local imports: Your data models from the models.py file

Class Definition (Lines 23-24)

Creates the main wrapper class that will handle all database operations
Centralizes all Supabase interactions in one place

Initialization (Lines 26-35)

Takes Supabase URL and key as parameters
Creates the Supabase client instance
Sets up logging for debugging

Trading Session Operations (Lines 37-206)
create_session method (Lines 39-79):

Converts TradingSession object to dictionary format
Handles nullable fields (historical dates, metrics)
Inserts into database
Saves associated price levels
Returns success status and session ID

get_session method (Lines 81-108):

Queries by ticker_id (e.g., "AAPL.120124")
Converts database record back to Python object
Loads associated price levels
Handles not found cases

update_session method (Lines 110-148):

Finds existing session by ticker_id
Updates only changeable fields
Replaces price levels (delete + insert)
Maintains data integrity

list_sessions method (Lines 150-183):

Provides flexible querying with filters
Supports date range queries
Returns list of session objects
Orders by date (newest first)

Analysis Run Operations (Lines 185-246)
create_analysis_run method (Lines 187-211):

Creates tracking record for each analysis
Links to trading session
Tracks who/what initiated the run
Returns run ID for subsequent operations

complete_analysis_run method (Lines 213-234):

Updates run status when finished

Allows for failed status tracking

Calculated Data Operations (Lines 248-351)
save_hvn_zones method (Lines 250-279):

Saves High Volume Node calculations
Links to both session and analysis run
Handles bulk insertion
Preserves volume profile data

save_camarilla_levels method (Lines 281-309):

Saves all 9 Camarilla levels (pivot + R1-R4, S1-S4)
Tracks which date's data was used
Maintains calculation history

save_confluence_scores method (Lines 311-343):

Saves scored/ranked price levels
Preserves contributing factors
Maintains ranking order
Supports historical comparison

Private Helper Methods (Lines 345-468)
_session_from_db method (Lines 347-396):

Converts database JSON to Python objects
Handles all optional fields gracefully
Reconstructs nested objects (WeeklyData, DailyData)
Manages timezone conversion

_save_price_levels method (Lines 398-427):

Bulk inserts price levels
Maintains relationship to session
Converts Decimal to string for storage

_get_price_levels method (Lines 429-453):

Retrieves all levels for a session
Reconstructs PriceLevel objects
Handles empty results

_delete_price_levels method (Lines 455-468):

Cleans up levels before update
Used in update operations
Returns success status

This wrapper provides a clean interface for the rest of your application to interact with the database without needing to know Supabase specifics or SQL syntax.
